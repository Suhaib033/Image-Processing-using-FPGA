# Image-Processing-using-FPGA
An efficient image processor utilizing the Zynq -7000 SoC. (Zedboard)

Interest in digital image processing methods stems from two principal application areas:
improving visual information for human interpretation; and processing of image data for
storage, transmission, and representation for autonomous machine perception. The
objectives of this article are to define the meaning and scope of image processing, discuss
the various steps and methodologies involved in typical image processing, and applications
of image processing tools and processes in the frontier areas of research.
